# Test task from 99tech company
In this repo i made 3 tasks (Three ways to sum to n, Fancy Form, Messy React) 

## Problem 1: Three ways to sum to n

### Task : 

Provide 3 unique implementations of the following function in JavaScript.

**Input**: `n` - any integer

*Assuming this input will always produce a result lesser than `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`*.

**Output**: ```return``` - summation to ```n```, i.e. ```sum_to_n(5) === 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 === 15```.

### Solution :

I solved this task in a file 'sumToN.js' and described my solution in the comments

## Problem 2:  Fancy Form

### Task

Create a currency swap form based on the template provided in the folder. A user would use this form to swap assets from one currency to another.

*You may use any third party plugin, library, and/or framework for this problem.*

*Bonus: extra points if you use Create-React-App for this task!*

### Solution :

Technology stack: React, TypeScript, scss, tailwind, Redux Toolkit, RTK Query, Create-React-App, FSD architecture.

## Problem 3:  Messy React

### Task : 
You should also provide a refactored version of the code, but more points are awarded to accurately stating the issues and explaining correctly how to improve them.

### Solution :

I solved this task in a file 'WalletPage.tsx'.
